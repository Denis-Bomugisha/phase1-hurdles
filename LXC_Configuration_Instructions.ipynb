    "# Configuring Ubuntu 14.04.5 or 16.04 to run LXC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing LXC\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS. They are likely not to work with other distributions of Linux. If you do not have access to a Ubuntu Linux system, you may also follow along using a Ubuntu virtual machine running in VirtualBox or an equivalent virtual machine framework. Each LXC container will be running Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ubuntu 14.04.5 Only: Update LXC PPA\n",
    "The version of LXC available in the Ubuntu repositories is fairly old. Get an newer version by using the LXC team's PPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-lxc/stable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and press \"Enter\" to continue when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ubuntu 14.04.5 and Ubuntu 16.04: Update Repositories and Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Next refresh your repository information and install LXC and Git by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo apt-get install lxc lxd git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add LXC Networking Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Update /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet by running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo nano /etc/lxc/lxc-usernet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the file to match the following, replacing user-name with your current user name.\n",

    "```console\n",
    "# USERNAME TYPE BRIDGE COUNT\n",
    "user-name veth lxcbr0 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When finished editing, use Ctrl+o to Output (save) the file, and Ctrl+x to Exit from nano. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Subuid and Subguid\n",
    "The default starting subgid and subuid has changed between the packages in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. To ensure a common baseline, update the subgid and subuid config files as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo nano /etc/subuid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the line associated with your username to the following, replacing \"username\" with your actual username.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify /etc/subgid as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo nano /etc/subgid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the line associated with your username to the following, replacing \"username\" with your actual username.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "username:165536:65536\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The updates to these two files will ensure LXC can correctly map container user IDs and group IDs to ranges usable by the scoring infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that these updates will break any containers created using a subgid and subuid base of 100000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up default LXC configuration\n",
    "Create a configuration directory for LXC and copy a default configuration file into it by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxc\n",
    "user@host:~$ cp /etc/lxc/default.conf ~/.config/lxc/default.conf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll need to set up user and group ID mappings. Edit the default LXC configuration file using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ nano ~/.config/lxc/default.conf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to run containers generated in either Ubuntu 14 or Ubuntu 16, update the default LXC configuration file using the following mappings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "lxc.id_map = u 0 165536 65536\n",
    "lxc.id_map = g 0 165536 65536\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update .local directory to be able to use defaul LXC prefix\n",
    "LXC needs other users and groups, specifically the other users and groups executing inside containers, to be able to execute their own files. Make this possible by adding the execute flag to your .local directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ mkdir ~/.local/\n",
    "user@host:~$ chmod -R o+x ~/.local/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update user groups to be able to use LXD\n",
    "Users must be in the lxd group to use the lxc import command, otherwise they will receive the following error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "Permission denied, are you in the lxd group?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command to add a user to the lxd group, replacing username with the actual user name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ sudo usermod -aG lxd username\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logout so changes can take effect\n",
    "You need to completely log out of the system, not just the current terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Log back in to test\n",
    "Test that you can create, run, and attach to unprivileged LXC containers by logging back in and running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~$ lxc-create -t download -n my-container -- -d ubuntu -r trusty -a amd64\n",
    "user@host:~$ lxc-start -n my-container\n",
    "user@host:~$ lxc-attach -n my-container\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is configured correctly, you should be logged in as the root user of the container, at a prompt that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "root@my-container:/# \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type exit and hit enter to get back out of the container. Shut it down and delete the container file by running:\n",

    "## Initializing LXD\n",
    "LXD will be used to robustly import and export participant images. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, it needs to be initialized once after installation. Initialize it by running: \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will prompt you for a series of responses. Use the following:\n",

    "Name of the storage backend to use (dir or zfs) [default=dir]: dir\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like LXD to be available over the network (yes/no) [default=no]? no\n",
