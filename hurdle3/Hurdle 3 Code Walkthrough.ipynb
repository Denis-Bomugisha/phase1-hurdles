    "# Hurdle 3 Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "All of the code discussed below resides under phase1-hurdles/hurdle3, available at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/SpectrumCollaborationChallenge/phase1-hurdles\n",
    "\n",
    "Performer solutions for Hurdle 3 must act as an Apache Thrift server frontend for code that learns to play a simplified spectrum sharing game. Performer solutions must respond to RPC calls from the Test Infrastructure container to execute a predetermined number of scoring trials. Each trial will be run for 30,000 rounds, with only the last 1,000 rounds being counted for scoring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Build Script\n",
    "build_hurdle_3_trusty.sh is a bash script that downloads a Ubuntu 14.04.5 64 bit LXC template and preconfigures it for use on Hurdle 3. It creates two containers, the Test Infrastructure container and the Solution container. The Solution container is a simple clone of the Test Infrastructure container. These containers will be stored in phase1-hurdles/hurdle3/lxc. Each container requires several GB of disk space, so ensure there is sufficient hard disk space before proceeding.\n",

    "### hurdle3.thrift\n",
    "hurdle3.thrift is the Thrift IDL describing the RPC interface to be used for Hurdle 3. Participants should not modify this file other than to add name spaces for languages other than Python or C++. Participants choosing to implement their solution in language other than Python may use this IDL to autogenerate the Thrift interface code for their language of choice. See here for more information on generating source code in various languages using the Thrift compiler:\n",

    "Hurdle3SolutionServer.py implements a Thrift server compliant with the hurdle3.thrift IDL. Participants implementing a solution in Python may use this file largely unchanged. There are two lines that participants must change to adapt Hurdle3SolutionServer.py to use their own solution. Those lines are called out in the comments in the following section of Hurdle3SolutionServer.py:"
