    "# Hurdle 3\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "DARPA will score all Hurdle 3 submissions by running participant provided code against DARPA provided test stimulus and scoring code. Both participant code and DARPA provided code will be encapsulated in the LXC container format. See here for an introduction to LXC:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/ \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository includes a build script for generating the DARPA Scoring Container and an example Solution Container. The **Scoring Container** is provided by DARPA and includes the test stimulus and scoring code. The **Solution Container** includes a stub solution which shows an example of how to interact with the Scoring Container. \n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating whether a participant's submitted solution passes or fails Hurdle 3, DARPA will use a Scoring Container built using the build_hurdle_3_trusty.sh script provided in this directory. The only difference will be in the particular transition matrices used for DARPA's state machine in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "See the document entitled LXC_Configuration_Instructions.ipynb at the root of the Phase 1 Hurdles repository for instructions on how to configure your Ubuntu host to run LXC containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the LXC Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "To build both the Scoring Container and the example Solution Container for Hurdle 3, run the following command from inside your cloned copy of the phase1-hurdles repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ ./build_hurdle_3_trusty.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will create a new lxc subdirectory in your current directory, containing two containers. Assuming the build script was run from ~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3, there will be containers in:\n",
    "\n",
    "~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3/lxc/hurdle3_scoring_trusty_lxc \n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",
    "\n",
    "~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3/lxc/hurdle3_solution_trusty_lxc. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run any of the standard lxc- commands such as lxc-attach, you will need to specify the absolute path to the lxc directory as the -P prefix parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the containers, you must start each of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The -P parameter specifies where LXC will look for containers. -n specifies the name of the container. This example assumes you have the containers in ~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3/lxc and are currently in the ~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3 directory. To run both containers, use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "First store the LXC path to a shell variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ LXC_PATH=$(pwd)/lxc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then start both containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ lxc-start -P \"$LXC_PATH\" -n hurdle3_scoring_trusty_lxc\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ lxc-start -P \"$LXC_PATH\" -n hurdle3_solution_trusty_lxc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the example hurdle solution against the DARPA scoring container\n",
    "\n",
    "You can SSH into each container now that they are both running. To get the IP address of the scoring container, use \n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ lxc-info -P \"$LXC_PATH\" -n hurdle3_scoring_trusty_lxc -iH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, lets assume that command returned 10.0.3.158. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the IP address of the solution container, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "user@host:~/phase1-hurdles/hurdle3$ lxc-info -P \"$LXC_PATH\" -n hurdle3_solution_trusty_lxc -iH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, lets assume that command returned 10.0.3.131. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our scoring container is then running at 10.0.3.158, and our solution container is running at 10.0.3.131. \n",
    "\n",
    "SSH into the **solution** container as the user sc2 with:\n",
