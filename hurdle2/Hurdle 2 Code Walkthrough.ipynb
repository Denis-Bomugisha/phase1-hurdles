    "# Hurdle 2 Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "All of the code discussed below resides under phase1-hurdles/hurdle2, available at:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/SpectrumCollaborationChallenge/phase1-hurdles\n",
    "\n",
    "Performer solutions for Hurdle 2 must be able to read complex samples from a TCP port, detect the locations of multiple instances of three different types of modulations and return the detected modulation type by bin number [0-30) using a Thrift RPC call. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Hurdle 2 folder includes code that runs inside the Test Infrastructure container. It also includes an example GNU Radio script to read the samples from the Test Infrastructure, and save them to disk. It also includes an example of how to modify autogenerated Python code from gnuradio-companion to add a Thrift RPC call one and only one time at the conclusion of a GNU Radio flowgraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Build Script\n",
    "build_hurdle_2_trusty.sh is a bash script that downloads a Ubuntu 14.04.5 64 bit LXC template and preconfigures it for use on Hurdle 2. It creates two containers, the Test Infrastructure container and the Solution container. The Solution container is a simple clone of the Test Infrastructure container. These containers will be stored in phase1-hurdles/hurdle2/lxc. Each container requires several GB of disk space, so ensure there is sufficient hard disk space before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Solution Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### hurdle2.thrift\n",
    "hurdle2.thrift is the Thrift IDL describing the RPC interface to be used for Hurdle 2. Participants should not modify this file other than to add name spaces for languages other than Python or C++. Participants choosing to implement their solution in language other than Python may use this IDL to autogenerate the Thrift interface code for their language of choice. See here for more information on generating source code in various languages using the Thrift compiler:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://thrift.apache.org/tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### hurdle2_solution_stub.grc and hurdle2_solution_stub_autogenerated.py\n",
    "hurdle_2_solution_stub.grc is a GNU Radio flowgraph that runs in the Solution container that creates a TCP client to listen to samples generated by the Test Infrastructure container. hurdle2_solution_stub_autogenerated.py is the code generated by gnuradio-companion from hurdle2_solution_stub.grc. It is not an actual solution and should be replaced by Open Track teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open track teams may use this file to record samples from the Test Infrastructure for offline processing during early development. The samples will be recorded in the standard GNU Radio Complex format. Users of MATLAB or Octave may process these files using utility scripts such as read_complex_binary.m. Teams may find this script in the GNU Radio source code under gnuradio/gr-utils/octave/read_complex_binary.m or at:\n",
